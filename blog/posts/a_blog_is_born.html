                <p>
                    Hello! I've been wanting to say this for a while, and I finally can...
                </p>
                <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Welcome to my Blog!!!</h1>
                <p>
                    Making something like this was always a huge goal of the website, and It's
                    nice to finally have done it. <br>
                    I feel the need to almost introduce myself again, but I think that's already
                    been done through my <a href="../../about/">about me</a> section... Though that page
                    still needs some more work, if I'm being honest. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel like there are so many things I want to discuss and just let my mind
                    run loose about; future plans for the site, projects I'm working on, and my
                    goals in computer science both academically and professionally!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've done my best to separate everything across their own pages, with everything being accessible through
                    the <a href="../../">home page</a>.  I know a lot of other small sites will put everything on one page
                    to remain a static site, but I really enjoy a menu layout, I guess. It adds more clicks 
                    for sure, and I'm 100% the type of person to optimize that sort of thing down to 0 clicks... but I'm almost 
                    scared that if I try to I'll loose the feel I'm going for with my 'Windows XP Theme', or at the
                    very least severely complicate it. So yeah. For the time being, the menu layout stays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the moment of writing this, the blog site is pretty bare bones. While the rest of my site is
                    fairly fleshed out with features and styling, this was made in a couple hours. I'm hoping in the future
                    to add a tagging system and an easier search function for when this blog gets more posts.
                </p>

                    I'm really hoping to make use of this blog more, so feel free to sign up for the RSS feed! It's linked
                    on the right hand column.
